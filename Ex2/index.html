        Manuela is an office for technical writing, transfer and preservation of knowledge, located in Kibbutz Sarid in the Jezreel Valley.
        The firm was established in 2009, and has since worked with a variety of companies, leading in their field, all over the country.
        Today Manuela is the leading firm in everything related to learning processes and transferring them to the end user.
        Our uniqueness is in the ability to learn quickly by observing and researching engineering, production lines and processes,
        and transferring the knowledge to the end user (customer / employee assembly line) in the clearest and most accurate way.

            The whole process takes place with us in Manuela, under one roof.
             We document the production process by using quality photographic equipment (video or stills, at the customer's choice) 
             and then edit the material into a booklet or instructional video containing the relevant images, three-dimensional models 
             (explosion drawings and references) and text in Hebrew / English.
